Stripe Integration
> Users should have a stripe customer toek in the users table.
> JavaScript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user 
fills it out, and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will
return with a card token.
> JS should send user fields and card token to our rails app.
Rails app should validate the user fields. Rails app will note 
whether plan 1 or plan 2.
> Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) 
and card token to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription 
and send back customer token. Rails should save customer token and 
user infofmation to our database.
